  <h2>Writing professional emails 101 </h2>

  <img class="img" src="https://www.gulfjobs.com/uploads/blogs/getty_494741050_325316_434.jpg" alt="Image">
   <p>AEffective communication is essential for achieving professional success not just in the United Arab 
    Emirates but around the world, not to mention in nearly every aspect of life. It should come as no surprise 
    that efficient writing emails are critical to achieving professional success in today's world, considering 
    the amount of contact that takes place online these days. For startups, in particular, you may be given a 
    great deal of responsibility from the beginning and be expected to contact external stakeholders and senior 
    colleagues from the beginning of your tenure there.
  </p>
<br>
So, what exactly constitutes an "effective" email? For the sake of this discussion, a successful email is one
 that fulfills the goal for which it was written. The absolute least that should happen is that you will get a 
 response. Beyond that, it should compel the receiver to do or seriously consider what you're asking them to 
 do - whether it's putting your product marketing strategy into action, using your company's services, or simply 
 meeting with you for coffee to discuss a business concept.
<br>

<h3>Authentic Subject Line</h3>
<br>
<p> We're all dealing with congested inboxes on a regular basis, so it's important to make it clear and
     unambiguous what your message is aboutâ€”especially in a business situation when you know the person who will 
     be receiving your message is already crazy busy.



</p> <br>
 
 <br>
<h3>Format your emails</h3>
<br>
<p>
    Your emails will be brief and to the point in the majority of circumstances. Bullet points, bold, and italics
     should be used in circumstances when an additional substance is required, such as the weekly email you send to 
     fellows and a meeting summary for your manager or a stakeholder outside of your organization, among other things. 
     Your message will be much simpler to understand as a result of this, and your major ideas and arguments will not
      be lost in the process.
</p><br>
<p>
    
If you're attaching a report or presentation deck, add some bullet points in the body of the email to emphasize the 
essential aspects of the report or presentation. This will guarantee that the recipient does not miss any of the most
 important points, and it may even increase the likelihood that she will open and read the actual attachment itself.
</p><br>
<h3>Do not use informal language</h3>
<br>
<p>
    It follows that you should completely avoid using shorthand and abbreviations such as LOL, OMG, and even Haha.
     It is inappropriate to use them in business correspondence. In order to convey the same message, whole words 
     such as "That's too hilarious!" and even a simple, "Wow!" should be used instead, which will come off as considerably 
     more polished and professional.
