  <h2>How to stay confident during an interview</h2>

  <img class="img" src="https://www.gulfjobs.com/uploads/blogs/_197898_bloghero_146.jpg" alt="Image">
   <p>It might be equally as crucial as exhibiting your abilities and presenting your unique 
    characteristics in a job interview to project confidence throughout the interview. It is 
    important to rehearse the manner in which you convey confidence and professionalism since
    doing so may boost your performance in the room while also calming your nerves if you are 
    nervous. This article offers advice on how to exude confidence during job interview situations.

  </p>
<br>



<h3>Importance of confidence</h3>
<p> Confidence is defined as the act of placing your confidence in yourself.
     During a job interview, espacially in Dubai, demonstrating your confidence
      in yourself is crucial since it might inspire the interviewer to place their 
      faith in you as well. Make an effort to convey to the interviewer that you are 
      confident in your ability to perform the duties of the position. However, it is 
      natural to feel apprehensive before an interview, so try to set aside some time to
       prepare for the meeting by practicing how to seem confident in your answers.
</p> <br>
<h2>Tips and strategies for boosting your confidence</h2>
<br><br>
<h1>Eye contact.</h1>
<p>
    If you want to project <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-to-look-confident-in-an-interview-even-when-youre-freaking-out"> confidence</a>, 
    start by making eye contact with others. 
    Maintaining natural and steady eye contact during your interview is a great approach to
    showing confidence and professionalism. Instead of establishing eye contact that seems 
    intense or protracted, try to maintain natural eye contact as much as possible. Before 
    returning your focus to the HR, take a few moments to glance over your résumé or any materials
    you brought with you to the interview.
</p> 
 <br>
<h1>Body language</h1>
<p>
    Following your efforts to improve your eye contact, you may find it beneficial to concentrate on your posture as well. In order to convey 
    confidence during your interview, your body language must be on-point. Begin by sitting with your arms unfolded on your lap to express an open
    and welcoming demeanor to the audience. Maintain a straight back, shoulders back, chest and chin high, and your shoulders back.
</p><br>
<br>
<h1>Appropriate breathing</h1>
  <p>
    Nervousness causes blood to divert from the brain to the muscles in preparation for either fight or flight.
     Blood flow to the brain declines, which might have an effect on cognitive abilities. Breathing slowly and deeply 
     allows you to replenish oxygen in your brain, which allows you to think more clearly and effectively.
    </p>
<br> <br>
<h1>Relaxation</h1>
<p>A person's fidgeting indicates that they are uneasy. Make a mindful effort to keep your hands on the table if you have a tendency to tap them or twist them.
     If you have a leaning to fidget with whatever you are holding, you should make it a point not to have a pen or paper in your hands. In the event that you 
     often shake your leg when you are frightened, you might maintain your hands on your lap and apply a little amount of pressure to remind yourself to cease 
     the shaking. Make an effort to ask a friend or family member to describe your fidgeting behavior so that you may become more conscious of your behaviors 
     and work on them. 
</p>
<br> <br>
<h1>Preparation</h1>
    <p>
    Making a list of responses to typical <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-ways-to-look-confident-in-an-interview-even-when-youre-freaking-out">interview</a> 
    questions is a fantastic technique to demonstrate interview confidence. When you come into an interview with 
    the knowledge that you have done your research, it may alleviate some of the stress and make you feel more secure. Consider sitting down with a friend or a 
    family member to brainstorm possible responses to these questions. Rather than memorizing answers, you should attempt to prepare enough so that you can 
    provide replies that you are proud of.
