  <h2>About Us</h2>

   <p>Are you prepared to perform admirably in your forthcoming job interview? In particular, 
    in the Gulf, one of the most crucial aspects of interview preparation is being prepared to reply well to the kind of questions that employers often throw at candidates.
    Because these interview questions are so prevalent, hiring managers will want you to be able to respond to them fluently and without hesitation,
    so practice answering them before your interview.
  </p>
<br>



<h3>Introduce yourself</h3>
<br>
<p> <a class="link" href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/interview-questions-and-answers">Interviewers</a> like hearing tales about the applicants they are interviewing.
    Make sure your tale has a strong beginning, a gripping middle, 
    and a compelling conclusion that will make the interviewer root for you to get the position.
</p> <br>
<p>
    Discuss a meaningful experience that piqued your interest in the career you are pursuing,
    and then go on to talk about your educational upbringing.
    Integrate your academic expertise and love for the topic or area that the firm specializes in,
    as well as your professional experience, into the narrative to demonstrate that you are a 
    fantastic match for the position. Whether you've overseen a complicated project or worked on
    an interesting, 
    outlandish design, be sure to highlight it
</p> 
 <br>
<h3>How did you hear about us?</h3>
<br>
<p>
    When questioning for a job, companies want to know if you are actively seeking out their firm, 
    whether you learned about the opening via a recruiter,
    or whether you were suggested for the position by an existing employee. In a nutshell, 
    they want to know how you came to be with them.
</p><br>
<p>
    If you were recommended for the job, be sure to mention who suggested you. Don't make the assumption that
    the interviewer is already aware of the recommendation. Most likely,
    you'll want to follow up with the person who suggested you find out more about them. For example, 
    if you and Steve (the person who suggested you) had previously worked together or if you met him over hi-tea at a networking event, 
    mention it to lend yourself a bit more credibility to your application.
    Provide an explanation as to why Steve, who works at the firm,
    believes you would be an excellent match for the position.
</p><br>
<h3>Explain dealing with anxiety</h3>
<br>
<p>
    The employer wants to identify whether you can maintain your composure under duress or if you buckle under the strain.
    They want to make sure that you don't suffer a nervous breakdown as the strain mounts and the deadlines loom close.
    The capacity to maintain one's composure under duress is a highly sought-after skill.
<br> <br>
    Please describe a time when you maintained your composure in the face of adversity.
    If it's a talent you're working on improving, 
    recognize that and explain 
    the actions you're doing to be 
    more effective under pressure in the near future.
    You may, for example, mention that you've begun mindfulness 
    practice to assist you in better cope with stress and anxiety.
</p><br>
<h3>Are you a team man?</h3>
<br>
<p>If you've done any research on the corporate culture and the
     position in question, your response should be influenced by
      that study. Nonetheless, you can anticipate that most job 
      contexts will include some element of teamwork.

<br>
    Every day, many occupations demand you to collaborate with other people, while others require you to
     operate alone in certain situations. When answering this question, make a point of
     emphasizing the positive aspects of your personality that
     correspond to the work criteria. Answering this question by underlining the positives and downsides of
     both scenarios may also be in your best interests</p>
